    <h2>Mission</h2>

  
    
      <section class="mission">
    <p>
      The AI Governance Reading Group is a student-led initiative at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign that brings together scholars across disciplines to explore the pressing questions surrounding the governance of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>
  As AI systems increasingly influence everything from healthcare and education to national security and labor, questions about how these systems should be designed, regulated, and deployed have never been more urgent.
      
  This group serves as a space to:
  
  Critically engage with the ethical, social, political, and legal implications of AI technologies.

</p>
      
     <p>
      Discuss real-world case studies, current events, and scholarly work in areas like algorithmic accountability, data justice, surveillance, and AI policy.
      
      Learn from guest speakers working in technology, policy, academia, and advocacy.
      
      Foster interdisciplinary dialogue among students and researchers who are passionate about shaping AI for the public good.

      We welcome participants from all backgrounds — no technical or policy experience required — only curiosity and a willingness to engage with complex ideas.
      
    
    Meetings are held biweekly and include a mix of reading-based discussion, speaker Q&As, and collaborative exploration of emerging topics in AI governance.</p>
